    <p class="measure-wide f4 mb5 center colour-w tc body-type lh-copy">I strongly believe that every woman should have the information, and be supported in their decisions, to experience birth and motherhood in a way that they choose.  I hope to support women, and advocate their individual decisions on what they feel is best for them, and their families, based on their personal circumstances and the information available.</p>
