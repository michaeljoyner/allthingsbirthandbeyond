    <p class="measure-wide lh-copy colour-p tc center body-type f4 ph3">I am a mum.  I am also a fully qualified Advanced Birth & Beyond practitioner (University of Worcester), with a background in nursing and complementary therapies, and have worked with families as a doula and childbirth educator since 2005.  I am committed to promoting and facilitating positive birth and parenting experiences.  This has motivated my continued research into practices and circumstances that impact birthing and early parenting experiences, including birth trauma and perinatal mental health.  Birthing approaches and resultant situations play an integral role in influencing early childhood development and infant-parent bonding.</p>
