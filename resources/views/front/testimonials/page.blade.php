            <p class="colour-p f5 f4-ns lh-copy mt0">I cannot recommend Mel highly enough. She enabled us to have the most positive birth after having had a previously traumatic experience. Mel is extremely knowledgeable, experienced and committed. During our 3-day labour at home she provided the support that both my husband and I needed giving us the faith to go on. Mel was hands on with practical help and most memorably coached my husband giving him the confidence and knowledge to support me perfectly throughout. I credit Mel with enabling us to have a wonderful home water birth after previous caesarean and what we believed was the best start to life for our son.</p>

        <p class="colour-p f5 f4-ns lh-copy mt0">I would highly recommend Melody as she is a kind, caring and supportive person, who’s knowledge I found to be very useful throughout.  She made me feel like she was there any time for questions I had about Albert and what I should/shouldn’t be doing!</p>

        <p class="colour-p f5 f4-ns lh-copy mt0">She was fantastic. She was so kind and full of knowledge on how I could achieve the kind of labour that I wanted. It went exactly to plan and not many women can say that. I have no doubt that this was due to Mel’s techniques with me during early labour. She taught me exercises to ensure that the baby’s head was in a good position for a swift, uncomplicated labour. Mel has a very warm personality and is extremely caring. I knew as soon as I met her that I wanted her to be my doula.</p>

        <p class="colour-p f5 f4-ns lh-copy mt0">Mel was with us for approximately 40 hours over ten days.  She was always at the end of the phone if I needed her - which was a lot! Not just with breastfeeding, but with everything that came with becoming a mum again. Helping me soon after the twins were born, through the baby blues, making sure I ate properly, being an advocate for me, helping me to focus on positives, generally lifting my spirits - the list goes on and on! She counselled me through those first weeks with the twins in so many ways, and we had some lovely chats and giggles along the way too!    My advice to you would be to get Mel on board.</p>
